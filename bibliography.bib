  abstract =   "We present a simple but powerful algorithm for optimizing
               the usage of hardware occlusion queries in arbitrary complex
               scenes. Our method minimizes the number of issued queries
               and reduces the delays due to the latency of query results.
               We reuse the results of the occlusion queries from the last
               frame in order to initiate and schedule the queries in the
               next frame. This is done by processing nodes of a spatial
               hierarchy in front-to-back order, interleaving occlusion
               queries with the rendering of certain previously visible
               nodes. The proposed scheduling of the queries makes use of
               spatial and temporal coherence of visibility. Despite its
               simplicity, the algorithm achieves good culling efficiency
               for scenes of various characteristics. The implementation of
               the algorithm is straightforward, and it can be easily
               integrated in existing real-time rendering packages using
               various spatial data structures.",

  abstract =   "We present a new algorithm for efficient occlusion culling
               using hardware occlusion queries. The algorithm
               significantly improves on previous techniques by making
               better use of temporal and spatial coherence of visibility.
               This is achieved by using adaptive visibility prediction and
               query batching. As a result of the new optimizations the
               number of issued occlusion queries and the number of
               rendering state changes are significantly reduced. We also
               propose a simple method for determining tighter bounding
               volumes for occlusion queries and a method which further
               reduces the pipeline stalls.  The proposed method provides
               up to an order of magnitude speedup over the previous state
               of the art. The new technique is simple to implement, does
               not rely on hardware calibration and integrates well with
               modern game engines.",
